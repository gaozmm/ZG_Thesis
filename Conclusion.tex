\section{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we investigate the transport properties of the first batch of tantalum nanowires with shadowed junctions worldwide. The nanowires' critical current is gatable and can be adjusted down to 15-20 nA, which endows the future working tantalum gatemon qubits with $\approx$ 5 GHz frequency, an optimal number for high-frequency measurement setup and device. The measured induced superconducting gap of the wires is around 110 $\mu eV$, which is lower than the aluminum shadowed InAs$_{0.3}$Sb$_{0.7}$ nanowires. Also, we develop a wet etch recipe on tantalum with up to 1$\mu m$ resolution. With the recipe, we successfully fabricate a twelve resonators' chip and get over two million Q internal factors in several thousand photons regime. With proper cleaning, terminators, and on-chip bonding, we can get over a million Q internal factors in the single photon regime. Additionally, we successfully fabricate a tantalum based substrate with tantalum shadowed nanowires chip and show supercurrent when measuring in the dilution fridge. Therefore, we have already accomplished the preparation works for fabricating a gatemon qubit chip.
