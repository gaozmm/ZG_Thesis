\section{Abstract}
Superconducting qubits are one of the most promising solutions to realize practical quantum computer. To realize universal gate operations, people develop gatemon to gain control on dynamic couplings among qubits through gate tunable qubit frequency. This thesis mainly investigates the prospect of utilizing tantalum for gatemon qubit. We report the transport properties of tantalum-coated InAs nanowires with shadow S-Sm-S Josephson junction. The tunable critical current is down to 20 nA, and high stability, repeatability is observed. Besides, we report the high-frequency measurement on wet etched sputter tantalum resonator with a million Q factor in single photon regime, which allows a long coherence time ($T_1$ > 50$\mu s$) qubit. The study provides a promising path to a high $T_1$ time gatemon.
