\section{Aluminum based shadowmon qubit measurement}

This chapter demonstrates the circuit QED measurement on the aluminum-based substrate with aluminum shadow nanowires, includes two-tone qubit spectroscopy, rabi oscillation and $T_1$ relaxation time measurement. This work is done mostly by Zhenhai Sun.
